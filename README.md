# calculator
A calculator with behavior based on the calc in macOS and iOS.

Built With:

Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS/Sass.


✅EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

-Not too bad to implement but was a little finnicky. 

✅EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.

-Had to redo it once - wasn't happy with the flat design I started with. Learned Sass along the way.

✅EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

-Pretty easy to implement.

✅EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support!

-Mostly simulated what would be the html button being clicked rather than having the functions run from the keypresses themselves.
